      <h1>Pangea: The Puzzle</h1>
      <p>Continental drift is a very difficult topic to grasp for some students. Pangea: The Puzzle is a board game and app design concept which explains continental drift to students in an exciting and interactive way.

      <p>My goal was to be very playful with the colors and typography to make it interesting for the students and to differentiate the information. I decided to use a lot of bright colors, but included brown in the typography and a gritty texture to bring in an earthy feel.

      <p>Pangea: The Puzzle encompasses two parts–the physical board game as well as the interactive mobile app. Users first learn about the processes of how continental drift took place through the dialogue and motion graphics. Next, the users can use the fossil finder which opens the camera of the mobile device. When the camera is pointed at certain marked locations on the board, a fact about that fossil appears and explains how it helped researchers in theorizing continental drift.
