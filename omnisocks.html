      <h1>Omnisocks</h1>
      <p>OmniSocks is an all inclusive, no B.S. sock brand that offers stylish, premium quality socks for a fair price. As the younger generations favor experiences over tangible items, it is important to create an experience in the product and a connection to our customers' daily lives.<br>

      <br>In latin, the word “Omni” translates to “all being”. The overall goal of OmniSocks is to create an all inclusive brand that expresses who our customers are. Through research I found that women often opt to buy men’s sock because they come in more styles and options. To cater to these needs I decided that the socks don’t need to have a gender which is one of the main selling points of the sock.

      <p>In designing a logo I wanted to design something that was modern, friendly and unique. Since one of the goals of the brand is to show off your unique personality, I found it would be important to create a mark that is only recognizable as OmniSocks. The tagline, “work like you play”, is used because as our target audience is 20-35 year old working adults. It sends a message that there are socks for everyone and every occasion continuing the inclusiveness of the brand.<br>

      <br>From the beginning I wanted to be very playful with the colors and typography to make the brand relaxed. I only used two fonts in the brand to make it as simple as possible. I found the font Gibson was perfect as it was simple, modern and friendly like the brand. For heavy weighted text I used Gibson Semibold and for lighter and bodycopy text I used Gibson Regular.

      <p>The final packages reflect the brand's simplicity well through not only the typography and color, but the forms themselves. I decided to make the packages white with a splash of color to let the socks be the main focus. Each package has a die cut of the logo on the front as another way of making sure the socks are the focal point.

      <p>Since our target audience is so young, an engaging web presence is key. Since the brand has so much to do with people’s lifestyles, I used a lot of lifestyle imagery that is trending right now. On the website specifically, I continued the simplicity of the brand with a lot of white space and a simple interface. On the home page you are greeted by a large banner image with text overlaid that is friendly and relaxed.
